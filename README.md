# RawLivestock-Dataset
The explosive growth of datasets has driven the development of computer vision; most datasets contain common objects and animals for humans. However, although these datasets have promoted object detection, the lack of specific real livestock scene datasets and benchmarks has hindered the development of intelligent livestock farming. In this paper, we propose the first uncleaned large-scale real livestock detection dataset, called RawLivestock, which contains 71,000 images, covering three major categories of cattle, sheep, and pigs. Among them, 10,000 images are manually labeled by professionals and have 17,792 bounding boxes.
